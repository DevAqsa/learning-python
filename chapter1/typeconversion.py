# convert 1 variable type into another variable type
""" two types of conversions are given below
1 - typer conversion -- automatically 
2 - type casting -- mannually
"""

# type conversion 
# a = "2"
# b = 2.45
# sum = a + b # 2.0 + 2.45 => 4.45 means the -- float is the superior value as compared to int so python create the int into float by default

# print(type(a))

# type casting
a = int("2")
b = 2.45
sum = a + b
print(sum)
