# tuples

# A built in data type that lets us create the immutable sequence of values

# tup = (1,2, 5 ,7)

# print(type(tup))

# print(tup[0])

# tup[0] =5 # this operation not possible in python

# types of tuples

# empty tuple
# tup2 = ()
# print(tup2)
# print(type(tup2))

#when we add the value in tuple like this tup = (1) then python treate the value as a integer

# and when we add the value of tuple like this tup = (1, ) then python treate this as a tuple

# methods in tuples

# tup3 = (1,2,3,4,5,4,5)

# print(tup3.index(3)) #return the index of the 1st occurance

# print(tup3.count(4)) # count the total accurances
